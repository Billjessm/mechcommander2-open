What is Mechcommander OmniTech mod?

The Goal of the Mechcommander OmniTech mod is to create an upgraded and more easily moddable 
version of the good old Mechcommander 2.  A game based in the universe of a great and fun 
franchise, a game with lots of tactical components and full of possibilities, which have 
unfortunately not being discovered by the Microsoft programmers or they simply couldn't do 
because of technical limitations and/or business pressure. 

Our Goal is NOT, to release a new campaign, there are actually a lot of good campaigns already 
available, and some of us are also working on a new one in their offtime (everyone for himself, 
since it's so damn easy :-) ).
